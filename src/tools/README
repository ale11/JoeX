WELCOME TO MUM TOOLS!

Introduction
************
The directory contains useful tools for preprocessing, postprocessing and verification.
Following tools are currently available:
* TestFlamelet
* TestCombustion
* CreateChemTable
* mum_hold

Compilation
***********
To compile the tools, you can:
* compile everything in the mum directory: make all
* compile only the tools: make tools
* compile specific tools within tools directory: make <toolname>

If you add tools, make sure to update the makefiles 'Makefile' and 'Makefile.dep' (in a clean way).

Tools description
*****************
                  
* TestFlamelet: Small tool to check if flamelets intersect or not in a given variable direction.
                This should be checked with the progress variable before the creation of the chemistry 
                table for FPVA since intersecting flamelets can create issues. Requires flamelet solution files
                and the thermodynamics properties file.

* TestCombustion: This tool performs verification of the combustion routines in the file 'Combustion.h'
                  and 'ChemistryTableXXX.h', i.e., thermo properties calculation and table interpolation.
                  E.g., it compares interpolated values from the table with the table values and
                  thermoproperties computed with existing flamelets.
                  The tool requires an input file 'TestCombustion.in' and the two combustion input files,
                  i.e., the thermodynamics properties file and the chemistry table file. An example of
                  an input file can be found in the tutorial directory. It also requires the flamelet
                  files that are used for verification.
                  
* CreateChemTable: Tool that processes flamelet solution files and creates a structured chemistry table. It
                   can be used for both steady flamelet and FPVA tables. Moreover, it can either create
                   a structured Cartesian table or a structured "adaptive" table in which the value of the
                   progress variable from the flamelet solution is used as coordinate, i.e., the coordinate
                   of the third dimension is a function of the two other dimensions.2 options are available:
                   saving coefficients for analytical extrapolations or species for exact calculation of the 
                   temperature.
                   
* mum_hold: Small tool that does nothing but just wait. Useful to keep allocated processors if simulation crashes
            or needs to be restarted without having to resubmit job to the queue. To stop it, just issue the 
            following at the command line: > touch kill_hold .
                   
* 2dto3d: Small tool to create a 3D mesh from a 2D mesh. Needs a 2D mesh input file in the Gambit Neutral format
          with name '2d.neu' and create a 3D mesh output file in the Gambit Neutral format with name '3d.neu'. 
          It takes 2 arguments:
          - thickness in Z direction
          - number of cells in Z direction
          Note that you can change a few constants in the source file to adapt it to your need. For instance, you
          can define a scaling factor for all 3 dimensions, you can chose a different name for the input and output
          files. Note that the creation of an axi-symmetric mesh has not been finalized nor tested. Also, you must 
          check that the version of Gambit used to create the 2D file is correct (see constant GAMBIT_VER), otherwise
          change the source file. Should be eliminated a future versions.
          Note also that the 2D input file can only contain quads or triangles.
